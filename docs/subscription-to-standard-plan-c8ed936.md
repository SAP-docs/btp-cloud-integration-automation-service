# Subscription to Standard Plan



To subscribe to a standard plan, following are the required steps:

1.  Login into your global account in the cockpit.
2.  Create a subaccount in the Cloud Integration Automation service supported regions.
3.  In the left-side menu, choose *Services* → *Service Marketplace*. All the resources you are entitled to consume in the subaccount appears as tiles.
4.  In the filters area, select the *All Types* filter, and from the dropdown menu, select *Cloud Integration Automation Service*. You can use other filters to narrow down your search by the environments for which the Cloud Integration Automation service is available, capabilities, and its status.

    Active status means you are currently subscribed to that application.

5.  Choose the *Cloud Integration Automation Service* tile to see the Overview page. Here, you can find more information about the application including all the available plans.

    > ### Tip:  
    > You can also create a new subscription without opening its overview by selecting the three dots in the top-right corner of the tile.

6.  Choose *Create*.
7.  In the displayed window, select the *Standard* plan of type subscription and choose *Create*. A confirmation pop-up appears with the link to the **Instances and Subscriptions page**, where you can follow the status of your new subscription under the Subscriptions table.

    The Go to Application link becomes available once the subscription is activated. Choose the link to launch the Cloud Integration Automation service and obtain its URL. To find the link, either select the subscription row to open more details about the subscription or click on the <span class="SAP-icons"></span> \(Go to Application\) icon in the Application column.

    > ### Caution:  
    > To remove an application, select the three dots at the end of the subscription row, and from the menu, select *Delete*. All data related to the Cloud Integration Automation service will be deleted in the respective subaccount.


To configure your user access to the application, refer [Assigning Roles to the Users](assigning-roles-to-the-users-9ad530a.md) to assign the roles to the users.
