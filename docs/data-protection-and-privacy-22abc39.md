# Data Protection and Privacy

-   The Cloud Integration Automation service provider database stores email IDs linked to subscriptions of SAP BTP consumer subaccount names.
-   The service provider subaccount stores the selected systems and tenants for integration setups to execute workflows.
-   Logs don't store any user-related personal data.
-   Logs remain in the service provider subaccount for 90 days and are deleted afterward.
-   Currently, there's no self-service option to delete email IDs or transactional data from the consumer subaccount. To remove complete transactional data \(with completed and terminated status\) and their email IDs, you need to create a support request to the component **BC-INS-CIT-RT**.

    The support ticket must include the email ID and SAP BTP consumer subaccount name that needs to be removed.
