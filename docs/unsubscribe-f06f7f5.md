# Unsubscribe

To unsubscribe, the Cloud Integration Automation service from an SAP BTP consumer subaccount, a user with a platform Administrator role can delete the subscription from the Instance and Subscription in SAP BTP cockpit. This operation removes the active subscription technical linkage and all the transactional data for the subscribed subaccount. The transactional data once deleted can not be recovered again.
